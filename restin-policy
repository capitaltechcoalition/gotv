Turnout for off-cycle elections is often very low. To address this issue, Restin implemented two simple policies to make it easier for employees to vote:

On Election Days
-    Any employee who is registered to vote in the jurisdiction holding an election will be encouraged to work from home. 
-    All employees will be allowed to sign off / leave work at 3pm on election day.

We believe it is just as important for our employees to be engaged in their communities as it is for them to be engaged at work. Employees who cannot vote in the election district are encouraged to do something fun or service oriented in their community during the time off. 

This is a policy we will continue to iterate on in the future from Presidential elections to City Council races. If you are interested in implementing a similar policy at your company feel free to reach out. I am happy to share the email template I used to communicate the new policy to my team.
