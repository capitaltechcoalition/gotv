This email was sent to managers the week before the election.
    
    {DATE} is Election Day in {DISTRICT}
    Next Tuesday, {DATE}, is election day in {DISTRICT}. As a reminder: your teams are encouraged to work from home on this day if they live in {DISTRICT} so they can get to the polls easily. If you have any questions, let me know, but basically my advice is and/or would be this: be cool, trust your people, let them get their jobs done.
